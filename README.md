# ENPS APP
This is an app for neuropsychological assessment. It allows the user to administrate cognitive tests and access previously administered evaluations. This is a open access cut version of a wider app that currently runs at a private site. See deployment at [https://enps.herokuapp.com/enps]. The content of this app is in spanish. 

This version only allows the administration of the RAVLT test. RAVLT is a worldwide gold standard test for memory assessment. Evaluees must attend and recall a list of words in a series of trials. With this app evaluators can register, score and store results in a simple and fast manner. Assessment is done otherwise with paper and pencil and demands time and effort for scoring. 

Each evaluation is stored at a database (MongoDB) and can be resumed at any time. For this purpose, the app has a built in file explorer. 

The complete project contains more cognitve tests and creates a full report of the results.
